However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.\n","\n","How does it Spread?\n","\n","The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.\n","You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.\n","\n","for more details about Covid [click here](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YhvlVQbDhvcv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Note: This dataset has not been edited a lot only null values were changed into 0's and was made sure no change happened to the original datavalues"],"metadata":{"id":"l_l3gObDiRRd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Total Infection count in the world"],"metadata":{"id":"_s3ZOBlnhvf_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src = \"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/Total%20worldwide.png?raw=true\"/>"],"metadata":{"id":"xa0-lakzhvit"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Total Death count-Continent\n"],"metadata":{"id":"G4K_AM5Vhvlh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/total%20death%20count-continent.png?raw=true\"/>"],"metadata":{"id":"AaSZlteQhvoF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Infection rate-Location"],"metadata":{"id":"YmTVSQ6Dhvq2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/infection%20rate-location.png?raw=true\"/>\n","\n","[Click here to check the values](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/basavaraj.d4941/viz/infectionrate-location/Sheet1)"],"metadata":{"id":"YrBoFX0Ehvt7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Infection rate-top_20 locations"],"metadata":{"id":"dTjWdes7hvw-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/infection%20rate-top%2020.png?raw=true\"/>"],"metadata":{"id":"Q0NwSjgehv0p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Infection Rate - year_and_month_wise"],"metadata":{"id":"v8V8i2ROhv2l"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/infection%20rate-year%20wise.png?raw=true\"/>\n","\n","[Click here to check values visually](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/basavaraj.d4941/viz/infectionrate-yearwise/Sheet1)"],"metadata":{"id":"TU7h0mathv49"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Total vaccination-Continent wise"],"metadata":{"id":"lEyww28Mhv7a"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/total%20vaccinations-continent.png?raw=true\"/>"],"metadata":{"id":"OCnap3Wghv9i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Total vaccination-Location"],"metadata":{"id":"aB4jbGJfhv_8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/total%20vaccinations-location.png?raw=true\"/>\n","\n","[Click here to check values](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/basavaraj.d4941/viz/totalvaccinations-locations/Sheet1)"],"metadata":{"id":"WFHQzK43hwCN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Covid India- Total Count"],"metadata":{"id":"dMJrSfGvhwFD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/covid%20india-total.png?raw=true\"/>"],"metadata":{"id":"N_LfGdKChwHz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Covid India-Day_wise"],"metadata":{"id":"1ym_hFf6hwKc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/covid%20india-day%20wise.png?raw=true\"/>\n","\n","[Click here to check values](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/basavaraj.d4941/viz/covidindia-daywise/Sheet3)"],"metadata":{"id":"qV4Pik9Kp2Sc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Covid India-Location/State"],"metadata":{"id":"7wD-Ne_LqM68"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<p align='center'><img src=\"https://github.com/shadowmoon697/Data_visualization-of-Covid-19-using-Tableau/blob/main/pictures/covid%20india-location.png?raw=true\"/>\n","\n","[Click here for the values](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/basavaraj.d4941/viz/covidindia-statewise/Sheet8)"],"metadata":{"id":"mK2s3w5PqQUf"}}]}
